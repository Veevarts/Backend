# Pokémon TCG Scanner Demo App

This is a demo Flutter application for iOS that allows users to scan Pokémon TCG cards and manage them in a personal collection.

## Features

- **Scan Cards**: Uses the device camera to capture card images. (Scanning logic mocked with demo data.)
- **Top Cards**: Shows most valuable cards in the user's collection.
- **Recommended to Sell**: Displays cards recommended for sale based on mock market trends.
- **Recommended to Grade (PSA)**: Lists cards that would benefit from professional grading.
- **Auction House**: Simple listing interface where users can put cards up for sale.

This demo focuses on UI structure and uses static demo data. Replace the mocked data and scanning logic with real implementations when integrating into production.

## Running the App

1. Install Flutter on your machine.
2. Navigate to this directory and run:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```
