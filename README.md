# Creating a Product API Library

To create a product API library, use the following command:

```bash
npx nx generate @backend/plugins:api-libs --name=<product-name>
```

Replace `<product-name>` with the name of your product. For example, to create a library for "ticketing," run:

```bash
npx nx generate @backend/plugins:api-libs --name=ticketing
```

This will generate the necessary files and structure for the API library.
